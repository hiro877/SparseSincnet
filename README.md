SparseSincNet is Built with SincNet[1] and Nupic.torch[2]


## Prerequisites


## How to run a TIMIT experiment
Even though the code can be easily adapted to any speech dataset, in the following part of the documentation we provide an example based on the popular TIMIT dataset.

**1. Run TIMIT data preparation.**

This step is necessary to store a version of TIMIT in which start and end silences are removed and the amplitude of each speech utterance is normalized. To do it, run the following code:

``
python TIMIT_preparation.py $TIMIT_FOLDER $OUTPUT_FOLDER data_lists/TIMIT_all.scp
``

where:
- *$TIMIT_FOLDER* is the folder of the original TIMIT corpus
- *$OUTPUT_FOLDER* is the folder in which the normalized TIMIT will be stored
- *data_lists/TIMIT_all.scp* is the list of the TIMIT files used for training/test the speaker id system.

**2. Run the speaker id Learning.**

- Modify the *[data]* section of *cfg/SincNet_TIMIT.cfg* file according to your paths. In particular, modify the *data_folder* with the *$OUTPUT_FOLDER* specified during the TIMIT preparation. The other parameters of the config file belong to the following sections:
 1. *[windowing]*, that defines how each sentence is split into smaller chunks.
 2. *[cnn]*,  that specifies the characteristics of the CNN architecture.
 3. *[dnn]*,  that specifies the characteristics of the fully-connected DNN architecture following the CNN layers.
 4. *[class]*, that specify the softmax classification part.
 5. *[optimization]*, that reports the main hyperparameters used to train the architecture.

- Once setup the cfg file, you can run the speaker id experiments using the following command:

``
python speaker_id.py --cfg=cfg/SincNet_TIMIT.cfg
``

**3. Run the speaker id estimation.**
- TIMIT Dataset.
``
``
- TIMIT Dataset with back ground noise.
``
python speaker_id_evaluate_bgn --cfg=cfg/evaluate/SincNet_TIMIT.cfg
``
- TIMIT Dataset with randomly noise.
``
python speaker_id_evaluate.py --cfg=cfg/evaluate/SincNet_TIMIT.cfg
